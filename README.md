# About

This is my personal nix config. It's still in the making, but this is what I got so far:

- Secret rekeying, generation and bootstrapping using [agenix-rekey](https://github.com/oddlama/agenix-rekey)
- Remote-unlockable full disk encryption using ZFS on LUKS <!-- with automatic snapshots and backups -->
- Automatic disk partitioning via [disko](https://github.com/nix-community/disko)
- Support for repository-wide secrets at evaluation time (hides PII like MACs)
- Automatic static wireguard mesh generation <!-- plus netbird for dynamic meshing -->
- Opt-in persistence with [impermanence](https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence)
<!-- - Secure boot using [lanzaboote](https://github.com/nix-community/lanzaboote) -->

<!--
Desktop machines:

- [Secondary neovim instance](./users/modules/config/manpager/default.nix) as a better manpager
- System-wide theme using [stylix](https://github.com/danth/stylix)

Server related stuff: 

- Log and system monitoring through [grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) using
  - [influxdb2](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb) and [telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) for metrics
  - [loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki) and [promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/) for logs
- Single-Sign-On for all services using oauth2 via [kanidm](https://github.com/kanidm/kanidm)
- Zoned nftables firewall via [nixos-nftables-firewall](https://github.com/thelegy/nixos-nftables-firewall)
- Service isolation using nixos-containers and [microvms](https://github.com/astro/microvm.nix)

## Structure

If you are interested in parts of my configuration,
you probably want to examine the contents of `users/`, `modules/` and `hosts/`.
The full structure of this flake is described in [STRUCTURE.md](./STRUCTURE.md),
but here's a quick breakdown of the what you will find where.

|   |   |
|---|---|
`apps/` | runnable actions for flake maintenance
`hosts/<hostname>` | top-level configuration for `<hostname>`
`lib/` | library functions overlayed on top of `nixpkgs.lib`
`modules/config/` | global configuration for all hosts
`modules/optional/` | optional configuration included by hosts
`modules/meta/` | simplified setup for existing modules and cross-host config
`modules/*/` | classical reusable configuration modules
`nix/` | library functions and flake plumbing
`pkgs/` | Custom packages and scripts
`secrets/` | Global secrets and age identities
`users/` | User configuration and dotfiles

## How-To

#### Add new machine

... incomplete.

- Add <name> to `hosts` in `flake.nix`
- Create hosts/<name>
- Fill net.nix
- Fill fs.nix (you need to know the device /dev/by-id paths in advance for partitioning to work!)
- Run generate-secrets

#### Initial deploy

- Create a bootable iso disk image with `nix build --print-out-paths --no-link .#images.<target-system>.live-iso`, dd it to a stick and boot
- (Alternative) Use an official NixOS live-iso and setup ssh manually
- Copy the installer from a local machine to the live system with `nix copy --to <target> .#packages.<target-system>.installer-package.<target>`

Afterwards:

- Run `install-system` in the live environment and reboot
- Retrieve the new host identity by using `ssh-keyscan <host/ip> | grep -o 'ssh-ed25519.*' > hosts/<host>/secrets/host.pub`
- (If the host has guests, also retrieve their identities!)
- Rekey the secrets for the new identity `nix run .#rekey`
- Deploy again

#### Remote encrypted unlock

If a host uses encrypted root together with the `common/initrd-ssh.nix` module,
it can be unlocked remotely by connecting via ssh on port 4 and executing `systemd-tty-ask-password-agent`.

#### Show QR for external wireguard client

nix run show-wireguard-qr
then select the host in the fzf menu

#### New secret

...

## Stuff

- Generate, edit and rekey secrets with `agenix <generate|edit|rekey>`

To be able to decrypt the repository-wide secrets (files that contain my PII and are thus hidden from public view),
you will need to <sub>(be me and)</sub> add nix-plugins and point it to `./nix/extra-builtins.nix`.
The devshell will do this for you automatically. If this doesn't work for any reason, this can also be done manually:

1. Get nix-plugins: `NIX_PLUGINS=$(nix build --print-out-paths --no-link nixpkgs#nix-plugins)`
2. Run all commands with `--option plugin-files "$NIX_PLUGINS"/lib/nix/plugins --option extra-builtins-file ./nix/extra-builtins.nix`

## Misc

Generate self-signed cert, e.g. for kanidm internal communication to proxy:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes \
  -keyout selfcert.key -out selfcert.crt -subj \
  "/CN=example.com" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:example.com,DNS:sub1.example.com,DNS:sub2.example.com,IP:10.0.0.1"
```
